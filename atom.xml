    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my Hexo blog! I’m assigned to write about what influenced me to learn code. Well, if I had to say, I’d have to be for those fat paychecks. Nah, just kidding. This stuff is way too hard to get into it just for the money. I think the number one reason I was pulled into programming was for the problem solving and craftsmanship of the field. Programming is very objective and exact, involving a lot of math and logic. But programming can also be seen as a very creative craft, something you use to make practical things you use in the real world.  </p>
<p>It being a craft means that it can be seen as a skill you improve in and strive to master over time (even though that’s likely impossible). It’s a very influential field, making it very easy to create something that can affect so many people. I’m definitely nowhere near that point with my skill level, but I’m motivated and inspired by so many others at that level. This to me makes programming a great path to pursue mastery in.   </p>
<p>Initially when I started learning this stuff in college, I was a bit intimidated by it. I had doubts and second thoughts on whether I can actually do this and actually considered other career paths. But I then realized the difficulty was actually positive, in that the challenge actually kept me engaged and focused. I started to embrace it knowing that the finished product will usually be worth it.   </p>
<p>The field is also growing very quickly. There’s always something new going on involving so many areas and specialties, it’s crazy to think what this field will be like in 10+ years. That’s very exciting! And that includes a growing coolness factor. Nerds rule the world; it’s pretty much fact now.</p>
<p>There are many reasons I see why someone would get hooked into programming and turn it into a career. Which is why you see so many passionate people in it. But yeah, that’s what inspires me to learn this and that’s all I have on the topic.    </p>
